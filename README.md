From the implementation of the two methods, the concurrent version is designed to handle concurrent execution more robustly, 
ensuring data integrity through synchronization mechanisms like semaphores. However, proper exception handling and avoiding 
deadlocks are important considerations when working with synchronization primitives like semaphores.
